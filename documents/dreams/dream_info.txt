beware now, the eyeball demons,
as they flap their wing, humans screaming,
while ruins in stone, vibrates like megaphone,
by an interstate with a strip mall,
with a pizza parlor down the hall.
To think there was a save point,
like it was Kingdom Hearts,
rather than hellfire, full of eyeball demons.
